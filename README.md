<i>Beyond Black and White: Visualizing Charlotte's Busing</i>

Description: A website created by Nicole Coscolluela, Megan Cullen, Jason Norris, and Jeanette Shaffer for a digital history class at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. All maps were created on CartoDB using publicly available datasets. <i>Beyond Black and White: Visualizing Charlotte's Busing</i> tells the story of Charlotte, NC from the 1950s to the present day. Our argument is that Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools, after decades of integration achieved by mandatory busing, are resegregating themselves. We take our story from <i>Brown v. Board</i> to <i>Swann v. Mecklenburg</i> down to the rise of charter schools in 1996. We wish to show that integration is not something which can be achieved and then abandoned; it is a continuous effort, a striving toward an ideal. As of 2016, Charlotte has stopped trying; thinking it has achieved integration, it has allowed segregation to reassert itself. The story of Charlotte's schools is not simple, it goes beyond black and white.
